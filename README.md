# MonteCarlo

A simple pythonic implementation of Monte Carlo. This module is used for the study of classical statistical mechanics, and mainly supports to the Ising-like Hamiltonian. For the Hamiltonian defined on the continuous value, as XY model, limited supports are also possible. There are two types of algorithms provided:

* Metropolis
* Wolff cluster (developing) 

# Requirement:
Only Numpy is required and Anaconda is highly recommanded.
* Numpy

# Classes
A list of basic class in [./src]
* lattice
* metropolis
* wolff_cluster
* measurement

# How to use it?
